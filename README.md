## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

While building the project i got to practise some of the lessons i was taught on areas like flexbox, flexbox alignment properties, using SCSS variables, SCSS nesting etc.

### Continued development

I wish to further uses SCSS more in upcoming projects as it is time effective and helps write DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) code
